      "  Journal: Nature genetics\n",
      "  PubMed ID: 40858905\n",
      "  Abstract: Despite the high prevalence of ERG transcription factor translocations in prostate cancer, the mechanism of tumorigenicity remains poorly understood. Using lineage tracing, we find the tumor-initiating activity of ERG resides in a subpopulation of murine basal cells that coexpress luminal genes (BasalLum) and not in the larger population of ERG+ luminal cells. Upon ERG activation, BasalLum cells give rise to highly proliferative intermediate (IM) cells with stem-like features that coexpress basal, luminal, hillock and club marker genes, before transitioning to Krt8+ luminal cells. Transcriptomic analysis of ERG+ human prostate cancers confirms the presence of rare ERG+ BasalLum cells, as well as IM cells whose presence is associated with a worse prognosis. Single-cell analysis revealed a chromatin state in ERG+ IM cells enriched for STAT3 transcription factor binding sites and elevated expression of the KMT2A/MLL1 and DOT1L, all three of which are essential for ERG-driven tumorigenicity in vivo. In addition to providing translational opportunities, this work illustrates how single-cell approaches combined with lineage tracing can identify cancer vulnerabilities not evident from bulk analysis.\n",

      "  PubMed ID: 39406498\n",
      "  Abstract: High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies have been instrumental in investigating biological questions at the bulk and single-cell levels. Comparative analysis of two HTS data sets often relies on testing the statistical significance for the difference of two negative binomial distributions (DOTNB). Although negative binomial distributions are well studied, the theoretical results for DOTNB remain largely unexplored. Here, we derive basic analytical results for DOTNB and examine its asymptotic properties. As a state-of-the-art application of DOTNB, we introduce DEGage, a computational method for detecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in scRNA-seq data. DEGage calculates the mean of the sample-wise differences of gene expression levels as the test statistic and determines significant differential expression by computing the P-value with DOTNB. Extensive validation using simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets demonstrates that DEGage outperforms five popular DEG analysis tools: DEGseq2, DEsingle, edgeR, Monocle3, and scDD. DEGage is robust against high dropout levels and exhibits superior sensitivity when applied to balanced and imbalanced data sets, even with small sample sizes. We utilize DEGage to analyze prostate cancer scRNA-seq data sets and identify marker genes for 17 cell types. Furthermore, we apply DEGage to scRNA-seq data sets of mouse neurons with and without fear memory and reveal eight potential memory-related genes overlooked in previous analyses. T...\n",

      "  PubMed ID: 39385256\n",
      "  Abstract: Aging of the male prostate is an inevitable process in which the prostate undergoes hyperplasia, and this growth may lead to compression of the urethra, resulting in voiding dysfunction and associated symptoms, and an increased risk of prostate cancer. Despite the significance of prostate aging, the molecular mechanisms involved are still not fully understood. Prostate split by lobes from young (2 months) and aged (24 months) mice were collected for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Tissues from both anterior prostate (AP) and ventral/dorsal/lateral prostate (VDLP) were included in the study. Data analysis included unsupervised clustering using the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm to identify distinct cell types based on marker gene expression. Differential gene expression analysis was performed to identify age-related changes in gene expression across different cell types. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted to elucidate biological pathways associated with differentially expressed genes. Additionally, cellular interactions and developmental trajectories were analyzed to characterize cellular dynamics during prostate aging. The single-cell transcriptome analysis of the mouse prostate during aging revealed heterogeneity across various cell types and their changes during the aging process. We found a significant increase in the proportion of mesenchymal and immune cells in aged mice. Our study unveiled alterations in genes a...\n",

      "  Abstract: Adult mammalian stem cells play critical roles in normal tissue homeostasis, as well as in tumor development, by contributing to cell heterogeneity, plasticity, and development of drug resistance. The relationship between different types of normal and cancer stem cells is highly controversial and poorly understood. Here, we carried out gene expression network analysis of normal and tumor samples from genetically heterogeneous mice to create network metagenes for visualization of stem-cell networks, rather than individual stem-cell markers, at the single-cell level during multistage carcinogenesis. We combined this approach with lineage tracing and single-cell RNASeq of stem cells and their progeny, identifying a previously unrecognized hierarchy in which Lgr6+ stem cells from tumors generate progeny that express a range of other stem-cell markers including Sox2, Pitx1, Foxa1, Klf5, and Cd44. Our data identify a convergence of multiple stem-cell and tumor-suppressor pathways in benign tumor cells expressing markers of lineage plasticity and oxidative stress. This same single-cell population expresses network metagenes corresponding to markers of cancer drug resistance in human tumors of the skin, lung and prostate. Treatment of mouse squamous carcinomas in vivo with the chemotherapeutic cis-platin resulted in elevated expression of the genes that mark this cell population. Our data have allowed us to create a simplified model of multistage carcinogenesis that identifies distin...\n",

      "  Journal: American journal of clinical and experimental urology\n",
      "  PubMed ID: 36636696\n",
      "  Abstract: Benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer are common diseases that involve the overgrowth of prostatic tissue. Although their pathologies and symptoms differ, both diseases show aberrant activation of prostate progenitor cell phenotypes in a tissue that should be relatively quiescent. This phenomenon prompts a need to better define the normal prostate progenitor cell phenotype and pursue the discovery of causal networks that could yield druggable targets to combat hyperplastic prostate diseases. We used single-cell (sc) RNA-Seq analysis to confirm the identity of a luminal progenitor cell population in both the hormonally intact and castrated mouse prostate. Using marker genes from our scRNA-Seq analysis, we identified factors necessary for the regeneration phenotype of prostate organoids derived from mice and humans in vitro. These data outline potential factors necessary for prostate regeneration and utilization of scRNA-Seq approaches for the identification of pharmacologic strategies targeting critical cell populations that drive prostate disease.\n",
